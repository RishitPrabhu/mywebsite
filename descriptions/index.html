                <p>
                        Hey Guys ðŸ‘‹,
                </p>
                <p>
                        I'm <b>Rishit</b> and love Engineering stuffs. I have disassembled, studied, tried to reassemble and failed to close
                        many electronic devices. Despite costing REAL LIFE MONEY (and not vbucks) to repair it (or to replace), my inner curiosity
                        stills tries to push me to do it again and again.
                </p>
                <p>
                        And this is why I love Software. I can open it, break it, modify it and build it back for my personal use and
                        no one ever complains. Since I joined Symbiosis Institue of Technology, Pune for <b>Bachelors in Technology
                        in Robotics and Automation</b>, I have joined clubs, attended events and took part in hackathons and worked 
                        on projects to understand more about this Mankind's Ultimate Mathematical Device.

                <h3>GDSC STUDENT CONTRIBUTOR [2024 - Present]</h3>
                <p>Joining a Coding oriented club from the start has allowed me to be ahead of peers
                        when in fields it comes to implementing new technologies in everyday projects.
                        I have since then met several seniors, industry people, peers from within and 
                        outside college.

                <p>
                        Realising my passion for Game Development, I have joined this club to help me
                        learn new things and be a more goal-oriented individual. I have worked on many projects even though it has been
                        only 2.5 months since my joining. Being a Core Member also allows me to see behind the screen moments of how various
                        events, interviews and finances work.

                <p>
                        Well I am a very curious and fast learner. I love building projects that will be used by me or by others in future.
                        In the first year of college I have tried various things, among which the ones which I like are Game Development,
                        Python Programming and Web Development.

                                This Project started by the ARVR & Gamedev Club is in its final stage of completion
                                and my contribution to it is in adding 2nd and Ground Floor.

                        <p>
                        Since School times, I have never hesitated to take leadership roles. I believe if I join your
                        organization I will bring improvements in not only the technical sector but also in the management sector.
                        I have a keen curiosity to understand the underlying layers of how something works. This has allowed
                        me to explain complicated technical stuff even to non - technical people.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        When I join your organization, I will aim to promote peer-to-peer and junior-to-senior communication
                        and also introduce the feeback system in managerial positions. I also keen to listen to advice from
                        juniors, peers and seniors and implement them in my own personal understanding.
                        </p>
